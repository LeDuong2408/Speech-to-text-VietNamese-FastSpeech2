# Speech-to-text-VietNamese-FastSpeech2
Using the FastSpeech 2 model to convert Vietnamese text into speech with a distinctive Central Vietnamese accent
1.Introduction to the FastSpeech2 Model:
  - You can learn more by reading this paper: [FastSpeech2 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558)
  - Or watch our team's presentation in Vietnamese on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/-n-oN0bqxRo)
2. Our Results:
  - The model can analyze and synthesize Mel-Spectrograms that are nearly identical to those generated from the original audio. The synthesized speech from these Mel-Spectrograms clearly pronounces letters, numbers, and dates.
  - Mel-Spectrogram generated from the original audio: \
